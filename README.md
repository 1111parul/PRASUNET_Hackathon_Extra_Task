# Water_Potability_Ananlysis
This repository contains a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing various parameters for evaluating water's potability.
Various histograms, correlation heatmap and a water potability subplot is included in the repository to analyse the water quality and drinkability based on various parameters(ph, sulfates, conductivity, organic carbon etc).
